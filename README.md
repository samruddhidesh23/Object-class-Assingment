# Object-class-Assingment

You have a class Person with attributes name and age. Two other classes, Employee and Student, inherit from Person. The Employee class has an additional attribute salary, and the Student class has an additional attribute grade.

Create a Holder class that can store objects of any type. In the main method, create an array of Holder objects that store objects of type Person, Employee, and Student. When iterating over this array, if the object is of type Employee, print the salary; if it is of type Student, print the grade; and if it is a Person, just print the name and age. Use typecasting for accessing subclass-specific attributes.

Description:
Define a base class Person with attributes name and age and a toString() method.
Define subclasses Employee and Student that extend Person and have their own additional attributes.
Store objects of type Person, Employee, and Student in an array of Holder objects.
Use typecasting to access subclass-specific attributes during iteration.
